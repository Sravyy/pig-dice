create player name, total score
create current roll , its number displayed
create turn score, its value calculated based on ROLL and hold
create 2 buttons , Roll and hold
everytime user rolls, assign current roll and its values
everytime user holds, add the turnScore to totalscore
if user hits 1, pass the turn(next turn) to 2nd player, dnt add the turnscore to totalscore

define next turn, active user in js




set the basic turnScore, turnIndex to 0 //in js

define a constructor that defines player's name and score(total score);

use this constructor to create a prototype for ROLL (this will have the calculation needed for the random dice roll) - define what happens when it hits 1, else cases.

use the constructor to create a prototype that define the HOLD function. - this adds the turnScore to totalscore i.e, playerscore, gives nextTurn.

define nextTurn; 1, Here we set who is the active player based on the turnIndex(user defined variable).2, to switch between players, we use toggleClass .add a CLASS active-user in one HTML div player and pass that in toggleClass to switch between multiple players.

create players to prompt names , pass it to player1 and 2;

create a function to updatedisplay - currentroll number, turnscore.


prompt users to enter names outside the document;

FRONTEND LOGIC:

1. update those names as player1 and 2 once the page loads.
2. when he clicks roll button, call roll();
3. when he clicks hold, call hold();, update playertotal
  if score reaches 100, display alert that he wins, reload the page
  if not, reset turnscore, turnIndex to 0;
  call nextTurn.
